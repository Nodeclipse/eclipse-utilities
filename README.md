##OS X Eclipse Launcher##


This feature will add an **Open Workspace** menu item that will detect the application of the running Eclipse instance and start another in a fashion similar to the **Switch Workspace** command.

Now with all these Eclipse instances up and running it is probably a good idea to be able to tell them apart. The workspace name can be set in (**Preferences > General > Workspace**) and it will show up in the icon badge.

Note that OS X 10.6 or newer is required as this feature relies on the [open](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html) command's ability to pass on arguments.
